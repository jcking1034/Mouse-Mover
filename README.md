# Mouse Mover

This week-long project was completed by Kayla Song and me for our capstone project in a course during Spring 2019 which studied the Internet of Things. Our goal for this project was to create something practical and functional using a [SensorTile](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stlkt01v1.html) and a provided framework with which to interact with it. Therefore, we took advantage of the SensorTile's accelerometer to control the cursor on our laptops, prototyping a device that could improve accessibility and/or interaction with our computers. We ultimately [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oHrMRUYwm5HmnlrB9qeoLqcfubwMSLr9RW_NP-4F5oc/edit?usp=sharing) and demonstrated this project.

Included here are:
1. The framework provided for interacting with the SensorTile throughout the course, modified to better interface with our Python code.
2. Python code to interpret and react to SensorTile information, appropriately manipulating the mouse. We have implemented gestures to move the mouse, click, and scroll.
