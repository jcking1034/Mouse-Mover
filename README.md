# Mouse Mover

This week-long project was completed by Kayla Song and me for our capstone project in a course during Spring 2019 which studied the Internet of Things. Our goal for this project was to create something practical and functional using a [SensorTile](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stlkt01v1.html) and a provided framework with which to interact with it. Therefore, we took advantage of the SensorTile's accelerometer to control the cursor on our laptops, prototyping a device that could improve accessibility and/or interaction with our computers. We ultimately [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oHrMRUYwm5HmnlrB9qeoLqcfubwMSLr9RW_NP-4F5oc/edit?usp=sharing) and demonstrated this project.
